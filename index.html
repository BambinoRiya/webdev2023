        I am a student at UG. My reasearch focuses on fun things full of woe
        like the Addam's family and punk rock marathons. I am obssesed with Kanye West,
        who goes by Ye now btw. I have big dreams one of them being able to build a website by the 
        end of the year. Mainly because i wanna make money and also because one of my super 
        smart teachers said she builds websites for fun. I wanna be able to say that; add it on my CV
        of cool stuff yunno. I like taking pictures too, when I really commit to it. I can go on and on.
        I am trying to populate this page with useless words. Alas! seems like this will do. Hope it looks like
        a lot on the webpage. Until nect time lovies! I am quite excited.<br><br>
